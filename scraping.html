<h1>Process : SCRAPPING</h1>
<h3> What are the Variants of the process</h3>
<p>As such there are no variants in the process, but there are variations in 
the tools used for scraping. Mainly there are two variants of the tool, 
one is known as hand scrapper and the other one is power scrapper. In 
hand scrappers the operator needs to manually apply the pressure while 
in the power scrapper the operator only needs to handle the scrapper's 
path as the electric motor present in the power scrapper produces 
reciprocating motion of the blade. </p>
<p>
There are variations in blades also. Due to these variations in blade, 
scrappers are given different names. There are primarily three types of 
scrapper(on basis of blade shapes).  These are flat scrapper(most 
commonly used), three corner scrapper and curved scraper. Three corner 
scrapper is typically used to deburr holes or the internal surface of 
bush type bearings. Curved scrappers has a slight curve in its profile 
and is also suitable for bush bearings, typically the longer ones.</p>
