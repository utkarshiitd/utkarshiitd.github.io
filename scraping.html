  <center><h1>Process : SCRAPING</h1></center>
<h3> What are the Variants of the process</h3>
<p>As such there are no variants in the process, but there are variations in 
the tools used for scraping. Mainly there are two variants of the tool, 
one is known as hand scrapper and the other one is power scrapper. In 
hand scrappers the operator needs to manually apply the pressure while 
in the power scrapper the operator only needs to handle the scrapper's 
path as the electric motor present in the power scrapper produces 
reciprocating motion of the blade. </p>
<p>
There are variations in blades also. Due to these variations in blade, 
scrappers are given different names. There are primarily three types of 
scrapper(on basis of blade shapes).  These are flat scrapper(most 
commonly used), three corner scrapper and curved scraper. Three corner 
scrapper is typically used to deburr holes or the internal surface of 
bush type bearings. Curved scrappers has a slight curve in its profile 
and is also suitable for bush bearings, typically the longer ones.</p>

  
  <h3> What is the Mechanism of Material Removal in this process</h3>
  <p>Deformation and removal of material due the use of high force on the scrapper which
 results in application of concentrated and huge pressure on the 
material of work-piece is the mechanism of material removal process in 
scraping. In case of power scraper, the reciprocating motion of the 
blade generates huge force and heat on the material to scrape of a 
    portion/part of material.</P>
  
  <h3>How is relative motion between tool and workpiece is achieved in the process</h3>
  <p>Scraping can be done with the use of hand scrapers or by the use of manually 
operated power scrapers. Power scraping uses back and forth relative 
motion between tool and work piece. Linear relative motion is required 
between tools and work piece for the process of hand scraping. In case 
of hand scraping, the person performing the operation holds the tip of 
the scraper firmly against the surface to be worked with one hand while 
grasping the tool handle with the other, thrusting the tool against the 
surface with powerful strokes using the body’s weight in order to create
 a pattern. In case of power scrappers, an electric motor is used to 
    drive a reciprocating blade.</P>

<h3> What kind of shapes can be manufactured by this process.</h3>
<p>Scraping techniques can generate straight edges and flat surfaces in sets of 
three without having a reference standard. Scraping is used to remove 
small amounts of metal from a precision surface so as to provide an 
accurate bearing surface to within some tolerance. It is often used to 
debar holes, and a curved scraper that can treat the surface of bush 
bearings. Different shapes can be achieved by the use of different 
scrappers as discussed earlier i.e. flat scrappers, three corner 
  scrappers and curved scrappers.</p>

<h3>Some additional information regarding hand vs power scraper</h3>
  <p>Though power scrappers requires less human effort and can perform scraping 
task more quickly than hand scrappers and is used by most of the 
companies, a better precision is obtained only by the hand scrappers. 
Till date no machine has been developed that can give the same precision
 as the hand scrapper.
  </p><p>
Also, scraping is the only method for producing an original set of flat 
surfaces from which one can transfer that accuracy through to other 
surfaces by means of grinding. Lapping and grinding do not achieve the 
long distance flatness scraping can, as they act on the entire surface 
rather than local high or low spots. One of the advantage of scraping is the ability to take the tool to the 
workpiece, this can be useful when the workpiece weighs several tons and
 is difficult to move.
  </p><p>
Price of hand scrapers typically range from Rs.200 to Rs.3000 whereas 
for power scraper it lies in range of Rs.20000 to Rs.45000.</p>

  <h3>What are the conditions and situations when this process is most preferred.</h3>
<p>  The conditions and situations when "Scraping" is most preferred are as 
mentioned below :
  </p><P>
1.) Accuracy - Scraping is done to align components within millionths of
 an inch, allowing for consistently-held, tight tolerances.
</p><P>
2.) Flatness - Eight to ten contact points per square inch are created 
to prevent rocking, add balance when tightening, and to allow for true 
flatness in parts.
</p><P>
3.) Oil Retention - Some machine surfaces are lubricated by oil spray or
 pressurized systems. Scraping creates oil pockets that hold oil on the 
surface and allow for gliding motion. Without these pockets, very flat, 
smooth surfaces will cold weld and restrict movement. Even worse, 
they’ll react erratically to applied forces, with high initial 
resistance to movement followed by a rapid breakaway, which is difficult
 to control consistently.
</p><P>
4.) Appearance - Once accuracy, flatness, and oil pockets are handled, 
parts are design scraped to achieve an attractive textured finish.The 
highest quality machines have always showed scraped ways so it has 
become a traditional measure of craftsmanship. 
</p><P>
5.) Hand scraping introduces carefully placed high and low spots on the 
mating surfaces of the CNC machine.For moving parts, introducing high 
and low points allows the two surfaces to glide together without 
sticking. For bolted parts, hand scraping creates a tighter fit, which 
is less likely to separate as a result of the material expansion, 
contraction and flexing that occurs during CNC machining processes.
</p><P>
6.) When working with large castings, it’s often impractical or 
impossible to mount the part into a surface grinder or mill, making hand
 scraping the only available method. With low cost tools and high 
portability, however, hand scraping is also used frequently when machine
 techniques are available.</p>
  
  <h3> What type of materials can be processed/manufactured by this process</h3>
  <p>Type of materials that can be processes/manufactured by the process of 
scraping depends on the type of blade used in the scraper. There are 
many options available for the blades of hand/power scrapers, the most 
common being high speed steel or carbide blades. Types of materials 
    usually processed by scraping are :</P>
1.) Carbon steel, alloy steel, stainless steel<br>
2.) Gray cast iron, malleable iron<br>
3.) Aluminum, copper<br>
4.) Titanium<br>
5.) Brass and Bronze<br>
6.) Plastics<br>
7.) Wood<br>
etc.<br>
  
  <h3>Does this process alter material properties</h3>
  <p>Material properties are altered by the process of scraping, especially the 
mechanical properties of the work-piece gets altered due to the high 
stress put on the work-piece for material removal process. Due to 
application of high stress, there are micro-structural changes in the 
work-piece and several dislocation are generated in it. This in turn 
alters the material properties like strength, malleability and 
    ductility.</P>

<h3>How to choose a Scraper:</h3>
<p>Scrapers should be fitted to the person doing the scraping. Just as a 
precision marksman has the stock of his rifle made to fit, so must a 
scraper hand have a scraper the right size to suit his stature and 
personal scraping style. A taller man has longer arms and to hold the 
scraper comfortably in the proper stance for long periods, it follows 
that he must have a longer scraper. A shorter man would require a 
scraper that is shortened for the same reason.
</P><P>
    A general guide for sizing scrapers to operators
        5' 5" and shorter = 18" or shorter
        5' 9" to 6' 2" = 18" to 20"
        6' 2" and up = 20" or more
</P><P>
Even with these guidelines, it is important to remember that each person
 will have their own preferences about scraper size so do not be locked 
in to this guide as an unbreakable rule.</P>

<h3>Choosing a Blade Type :</h3>
<p>Determining which blade material to use depends on how and where you 
will be scraping. The main advantage of carbide over HSS, is that it 
stays sharp longer, in some applications up to ten times longer. This 
means less time spent sharpening the blade and more time using it. The 
initial cost of the blade is higher, but this is more than overcome by 
the time-savings carbide offers. The main disadvantage of carbide is the
 requirement of a carbide tool grinder equipped with a quality diamond 
wheel for sharpening. Portable grinders do exist because carbide is 
nearly impossible to properly sharpen by hand, even with a diamond bench
 stone. Carbide also has a reputation for leaving a scratched finish, 
but this may be eliminated with proper selection and use of the grinding
 wheel used for sharpening.
</p><p>
The main advantage of HSS is the ease of maintenance. High-speed steel 
can be sharpened by hand to a very keen edge with a common bench stone. 
This makes the HSS blade much more portable than the carbide blade. When
 scraping "on the road" or in a shop without a carbide tool grinder, 
high-speed steel may be the only choice. The initial cost of the blades 
is also lower. The main disadvantage to the HSS blade is that it does 
not hold an edge as long as carbide. In some tough materials, this can 
make a HSS blade difficult to use because the blade may need to be 
  sharpened almost continuously.</P>
